## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The system (named Explorezy) allows the user to view travel locations such as restaurants, accommodations, city sightseeing, activities, and their information. Furthermore, the user can create an account. When logged in the user can add/delete favorite places and create/edit/delete trips that contain selected locations. Users can also create posts about locations which are displayed to all visitors of the website.

### Pages

The website displays a global navigation bar where the user can navigate to the “Places” page, choose to log in, or register as a user. The Home Page displays posts about places made by users. If the user is logged in, the navigation bar also displays “My favorites” and “My trips”.

The page “Places” displays a list of all places in the database. A search box allows the user to search for specific places to narrow the list. The user can click on a place to show more details. Here, the user can also favorite the place and/or add it to a trip.

The page “My favorites” displays a list of places which have been favorited by the user. Places can be removed from the list on the page.

The page “My trips” shows a list of trips. The user can add a trip, delete a trip, and click on a trip to view details. Clicking a trip reveals all places that are added to the trip. A place can be added or removed from a trip.
